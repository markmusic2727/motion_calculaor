# Motion Calculator

Motion Calculator is a simple yet effective program that allows you to calculate the value of speed, distance, and time. It does this by calling a master function that takes in three inputs: term1, term2, and solveFor. Term1 is basically the numerator. Term2 is basically the denominator. SolveFor allows you to tell the program what to solve for (time, distance etc.). The code then determines what solveFor is and calls a seperate mini function that does the operation.
